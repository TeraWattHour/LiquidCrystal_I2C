# LiquidCrystal I2C for MicroPython

This library is a port of the [LiquidCrystal I2C Arduino library](https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C). Although some methods are named differently, the main concept is exactly the same. This implementation doesn't require any other external libraries.

## Usage

1. Place the `i2c_lcd.py` file inside your MicroPython project.
2. Import the display class

```py
from i2c_lcd import LiquidCrystalI2C
```
